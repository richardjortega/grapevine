2.0 out of 5,I had a group of 6 and everyone's meat was under seasoned. The lobster bisque was very bland. The waitress was rude at times. I will not return to Morton's.,11/10/2012
2.0 out of 5,"we went here because we had a discount. the weekend before we had been to Roast. The experience at Roast really highlighted how deficient Morton's was for the same money. Lobster tail was just about tasteless except for the salt. The shrimp were prepped to be deveined but they hadn't done the last step and washed out the vein, not lovely. The filet was fine. Server was ok but scripted. I have no reason to go back here to spend $100 a person.",11/10/2012
1.0 out of 5,"Every year my girlfiriend and I celebrate our birthday by dining at a upscal restaurant. We chose Morton. First I will say the waitress (Sarah) was fantastic but the expectation in the food was not there at all. The best part of our meal was the bread & salad everything else was on the level of going to Red Lobster and even Red Lobster taste a lot better than what Morton serve. I was very disappointed in the restaurant quality of food, that was my first and last time going.",11/03/2012
5.0 out of 5,"We had a fantastic time at Moton's. Patrick gave us superb service and the food was incredible. While not a typical choice, we started with steamed crab legs for an appetizer. They were amazing. I love crab legs but don't usually order them because of the mess required to eat them. These came out sliced in two giving us access to the meat without any of the mess. The wet towels afterwards were a nice touch. The salads were the largest I have ever seen and tasted amazing. My fillet was done exactly the way I like it, and the shrimp alexander was a nice complement. Of the sides, my favorite was the cheesy a gratin potatoes. For dessert, we all had the legendary hot chocolate lava cake - awesome. If you havenâ€™t tried it, this Morton's is a d",10/31/2012
2.0 out of 5,"I have been to many different Morton's across the country and Singapore. And usually it is a fantastic experience. I went for my Birthday on Oct 29 and it was not up to par compared to my other dining experiences. My steak was dry, the shrimp overcooked and hardly any sauce, the wine suggested by the server was good, but the server was too casual in her approach and delivery and tone and no one sang Happy Birthday...there was nothing extra done to make my birthday ""sparkle"" they didn't even put my name on the menu...just Happy Birthday....so right now the Morton's in Singapore was the best...for service, food, ambience, and overall satisfaction...",10/29/2012
3.0 out of 5,"The only thing we did not like was where we were seated. It was a VERY small table, up against the wall. So the people next to us were just about on top of us, and the noise from the other half of the resturant was VERY loud. I made a reservation so it's not like they had to put us where we ""fit"" There were plenty of empty tables. I don't know why they put us at such a small table. A booth would have been nice, again, we DID have a reservation. It is not the fault of the person seating us, I'm sure they are told to spread out the customers.",10/26/2012

This is a restaurant inside the Hilton Minneapolis. Because they had a large group staying at the hotel that weekend, they were offering a buffet. My husband had salad, ham, peas with pearl onions, rice and two desserts - lemon meringue pie, and sweet potato pie. I had the ribs from their regular menu. The ribs were done well, nothing special.

The egg roll was tasty but the graham cracker ice cream was incredibly icy. The biggest problem we had was that the music was so loud that you had to shout to talk and the restaurant was not that crowded.

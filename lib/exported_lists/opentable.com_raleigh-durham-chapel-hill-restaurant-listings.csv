We shared an appetizer of the fried green tomatoes and it was agreed they were of exceptional quality, served piping hot with a spicy mustard dressing. For the main course we had the ribs, some brisket, roast chicken and the fish 'tacos' - all wer delicious although the fish tacos(not good for sharing).

Water and drink orders took a long time to come out, but the hostess did a great job coming by to check on our table. The food was mediocre at best. Sides seem dated (vegetable medley and mashed potatoes), and the medium rare ostrich came very overcooked. The flavor of the curry was fine, but came with an odd assortment of vegetables and bananas. For the price point, there are much better restaurants in Sandy Springs, let alone all of Atlanta. I",11/02/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore6/10-degrees-south,10-degrees-south

Walked in to a very inviting atmospere and we greated by the host (owner?). The bar looks inviting and it was a beautiful space. Alas, the kitchen didn't match the front end of the house. The ceasar salad came out weirdly acidic with not a hint of creaminess or anchovy - althought they did split it for my companion and I and it lookly very appealing on the plate. The pasta with artichoke & mushroom with chicken was just bland, bland and the pasta came out of a box. My companion's halibut over risotto looked and tasted overcooked and past it's prime. I might go back and meet a friend at the bar, grab a glass of wine and try an appetizer but don't think it's on my ""regulars"" list.

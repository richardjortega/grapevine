Water and drink orders took a long time to come out, but the hostess did a great job coming by to check on our table. The food was mediocre at best. Sides seem dated (vegetable medley and mashed potatoes), and the medium rare ostrich came very overcooked. The flavor of the curry was fine, but came with an odd assortment of vegetables and bananas.

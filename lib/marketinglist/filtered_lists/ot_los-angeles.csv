My partners 80 year old mother couldn't drive to our home, so we decided to find a nice restaurant in her area that was open. We were greeted by the owner and sat by the window of the restaurant. It was beautifully decorated for the holidays and the ambiance was great. Our waiter, James, was not only cute, but he was also very friendly and attentive. The Thanksgiving Day dinner special was a deep fried turkey and gravy with purÃ©ed yams, steamed carrots and a cranberry something. We were also offered three different dessert choices: Red Velvet Cake, Apple and Pear Pie and a chocolate dessert, which we ended up sharing.

Food was pretty good, my burger was great and sounded like everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. Price is just fine for the quality. I probably wouldn't go back just for the food but will eat here again before a show and I will remember to bring a big jacket next time.",11/10/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore6/the-world-famous-malibu-inn,the-world-famous-malibu-inn

Yojie Japanese Fondue and Sake Bar,http://www.opentable.com/yojie-japanese-fondue-and-sake-bar?scpref=110&tab=2,4.1,"501 W Olympic Blvd Unit 102 Los Angeles, CA  90015 ",37,Shabu-shabu,$30 and under,Downtown,http://www.yojie.com,info@yojie.com,(213) 988-8808,1.0 out of 5,I made a reservation for Yojie for a group of 8 people (it was my sister's birthday) on Open Table about a week before. I get there on the day and they apparently forgot about our reservation and nothing was set up. It was at that moment that they started pulling tables together. The place wasn't even busy and they had already been opened for half an hour. That's probably plenty of time to set up a table. So I had to stand there for 10 minutes waiting for them to get our table ready. I was holding a lot of birthday stuff. The floor was super sticky for some reason. They threw away my parking ticket by accident and I had to ask for a replacement about 6 times. Service was beyond awful. And the kicker was that the food was not even that good.,11/25/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore6/yojie-japanese-fondue-and-sake-bar,yojie-japanese-fondue-and-sake-bar

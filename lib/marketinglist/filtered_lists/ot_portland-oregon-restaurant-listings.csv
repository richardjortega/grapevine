This works very well for smaller appetites like ours. It also encourages sharing, which we did, by ordering 3 small plates and a dinner. All food was exceptionally well prepared and had the perfect balance of flavours. Wine list was not extensive, but more than adequate and priced mid-range. The ambience is very quiet and the restaurant furnishings are very comfortable. Only warning is that this place is more about quality than quantity, so those with larger appetites, used to ""meat & potatoes"", may not feel satisfied. But we loved it so much, we're looking forward to returning very soon.",8/16/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore2/gracies-portland,gracies-portlandTina's,http://www.opentable.com/tinas?scpref=110&tab=2,4.3,"760 Highway 99W Dundee, OR  97115 ",68,Northwest,$31 to $50,Willamette Valley/Wine Country,http://www.tinasdundee.com/,tinasdundee@gmail.com,(503) 538-8880,4.3 / 5,Still is a great restaurant in the wine country.

My only complaint was that the place seemed understaffed. The staff they did have was doing an amazing job however!That and our guacamole was almost entirely inedible as the avocado was hard. It should have never been sent out and when we pointed it out nothing was done to compensate... tho we did have a living social deal so that may have been why.

The server was extremely helpful and made the experience. The trout was excellent. The bread served with the salad was stale - and not up to par with Portland breads.

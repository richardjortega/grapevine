Truly a professional. I usually only see that in New York where young men have spent their lives in the service industry. Not too many of the fancy Scottsdale restaurants have this type of service.

I said to myself throughout the evening how impressed I was that Wichita had the talent to pull off a difficult musical like Sweeney Todd. The leads were strong and the ensemble cast was very good. Most of the vocals were truly impressive. I enjoyed every scene and was touched by many of the songs because they were delivered with such strong conviction. The acting was a bit uneven, the leads were obviously seasoned performers and created strong characters, but a few of the actors either over or underacted but their impact was minor in the overall production. The set design was stunningly effective and the stage was used to great advantage. The small orchestra was also very good.

The website stated the restaurant opened at five but when we arrived at 6 p.m. the dinning room was not set and the hostess had to ask permission to seat us because they ""weren't ready"" because of a wedding reception occurring in the adjacent banquet hall.",10/20/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore7/pavilion-restaurant-northbrook,pavilion-restaurant-northbrookPeople Lounge,http://www.opentable.com/people-lounge?scpref=110&tab=2,3.9,"1560 N.

My only complaint is that the plates were a bit overpriced for the portion size. We got only 2 bacon-wrapped dates for $6, which felt a bit of a rip off.

Great service. Really liked ambiance (old house). Really disappointed in the food. The bread and the dessert (profiteroles) were amazing. Didn't love the appetizer or entree. We had the escargot for an appetizer - it was tough and had no flavor. I had duck for dinner which I love. It was incredibly fatty. I know duck is a fattier meat but this was unetible.

They always see to it that you make the show with time to spare. They also change the menu quite frequently so if you go often you do not get bored with the same things over and over. The restaurant overlooks the Oakland Railroad tracks and trains go by as you dine - quite charming. The trains never interfere with the concerts. One of my all time favorite places to go.

The place was fairly empty and stayed that way throughout the entire time we were there. The appetizers were good but the entree's were pretty bad. I had the lamb shank and it was very dry! The roast quail tasted really gamey which is fine, but it just didn't do it for me.

It's just too loud to hear yourself think, let alone have a conversation with your dining companions. Bread was very late coming--we were told it was just out of the oven--but when it finally arrived it was stone cold. A minor thing: the olive oil for dipping is peppery to the point of bitterness; something more mild and fruity would be better.",11/24/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore9/zut-on-fourth,zut-on-fourth

The waitress was very helpful in that she understood that we were in a time crunch so she put in our order quickly and that things would be brought out as they were done cooking. That being said, I got the sashimi hamachi, my friend got the lamb chops, and my friend and her mom got two other tapas like items that needed real cooking and my dish came out dead last a good 10 minutes after everyone else's. They also didn't really even check to see what was wrong. The yuzu sauce on the hamachi was incredibly salty, more than I was expecting but the quality of the fish was good.

I couldn't get a reservation timed around sunset to take advantage of the scenic view (my fault for waiting too long to make a reservation) so we were in at 6 p.m. We were greated promptly and seated immediately. The restaurant is older and the decor is nothing exceptional but again, its the scenic view and the outdoors which set the mood here. The service was exceptional. The food was great. I thought it was a bit pricey but it was a special occassion and it's not the type of restaurant I would frequent regularly.
